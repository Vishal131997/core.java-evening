1. Super keyword is used to Access the methods of parent class.
   this keywork is used to access methods of the current class.
	SCP(String constant pool) is present in Heap Area.
	
3. extends keyword
	*A class can extend one super class.
	*Associated with interface
   Implementation
   *
   *Associated with abstraction

11. Types of construction;
	1.Default Construction
	2.Parameterized Construction
	3.Copy Construction
	4.Private Construction
	
9. Class and Object
	Class: class is a blueprint which contains states and behaviours.
	Object: Object is an Instance of a class.
	
	Characteristics of abstract class:
	
10. 00 Space of memory occupied by a class in java.

18. public class Pat {
	public static void main(String args[]) {

		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
				if (i == 0 || j == 0 || i == 2 || j == 2) {
					System.out.print("* ");
				} else {
					System.out.print("  ");
				}
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}

}

13. Abstraction displays only the relevant attributes of objects and hides the unwanted details.

6. Polymorphism: one object is behaving as diffrently  at given instance of time.
	*Polymorphism achived with the help of Inheritance
	Types of Polymorphism
	1.Compile time polymorphism -- Method OverLoading
	2.Run Time polymorphism -- Method OverRiding- to achive runtime polymorphism.

15. Types of Arguments 
		1. Premitive 
		2. Non Premitive
		
19. public class EvenOrOdd {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a=20; int b=7;
		if(a %2==0) {
			System.out.println("The Given Number is Even");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("The Given number is Odd");
		}
		
		if(b %2==0) {
			System.out.println("The Given Number is Even");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("The Given number is Odd");
		}
	}
